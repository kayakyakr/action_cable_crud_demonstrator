# Action Cable CRUD Demonstration

This project is a quick demonstration of how you could go about implementing crud in [ActionCable](https://github.com/rails/actioncable).
ActionCable is a very new project with the ultimate goal of making websockets a first class citizen in
Rails.

## Running

You will need: Ruby, Postgres, Redis, and an installation of Node.js to run this project. I used ember-cli
to code the front-end partially out of convenience, partially because I wanted to see how the [ember-cli-rails](https://github.com/thoughtbot/ember-cli-rails)
project worked. Please refer to ember-cli-rails for instructions on how to set it up.

If you want to see it in action on a cloud server, it's ready to deploy to heroku. Just need a postgres DB and a redis server
and then you will be able to deploy.
